# Password Generator

## Description
The Password Generator is a tool that generates strong and secure passwords. It allows users to customize the length, complexity, and character set of the generated passwords, providing a convenient way to create unique and robust passwords for various purposes.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance online security by promoting the use of strong passwords. Weak passwords are a common vulnerability that can be exploited by hackers. By using the Password Generator, users can generate strong passwords that are resistant to brute-force attacks and significantly improve their online security.

## Features
- Customizable password length: Users can specify the desired length of the generated password.
- Complexity options: Users can choose the complexity level of the password, such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Randomness: The Password Generator uses a secure random number generator to ensure the generated passwords are truly random and unpredictable.
- Copy to clipboard: Users can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard for convenient use.
- Password strength indicator: The Password Generator provides a visual indicator of the strength of the generated password, helping users assess its security level.
